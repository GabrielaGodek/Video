#### <center>handling video with jQuerty</center>
<div align="justify">
In this task, I upload a short video and design 4 buttons. By clicking the right one, you can play/pause, mute/unmute and resize video content. 

To do that I used a HTML5 properties such as `play()`,` pause()`, `mute()`etc. With this task I also practicing jQuerty.
